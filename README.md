### About
This is a leave management system which is currently modeled in a two step hierarchy of teachers and students in a many to one mapping.
The students only have an apply for leave button while the teachers have both apply for leave and manage leave applications of their students.
This system can be extended to more levels as needed by the institutions using this leave management system.

### Some features
This system also has a mail system built using SMTP - to send a mail to the teachers when any of their students apply for leave. They can then approve or reject their application through the mail,
which will then notify the student through the mail.
There is also a panel where you can see your attendance based on the time range selected.
This entire project is based on SQLite as backend, where the admin can edit the details of the students or teachers as needed and also add or remove users.
