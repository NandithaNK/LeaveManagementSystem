### About
This is a leave management system which is currently modeled in a two step hierarchy of teachers and students in a many to one mapping.<br>
The students only have an apply for leave button while the teachers have both apply for leave and manage leave applications of their students.<br>
This system can be extended to more levels as needed by the institutions using this leave management system.<br>

### Some features
This system also has a mail system built using SMTP - to send a mail to the teachers when any of their students apply for leave. <br> They can then approve or reject their application through the mail,
which will then notify the student through the mail.<br>
There is also a panel where you can see your attendance based on the time range selected.<br>
This entire project is based on SQLite as backend, where the admin can edit the details of the students or teachers as needed and also add or remove users.<br>
